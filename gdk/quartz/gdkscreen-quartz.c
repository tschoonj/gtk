/* A couple of notes about this file are in order.  In GDK, a
 * GdkScreen can contain multiple monitors.  A GdkScreen has an
 * associated root window, in which the monitors are placed.  The
 * root window "spans" all monitors.  The origin is at the top-left
 * corner of the root window.
 *
 * Cocoa works differently.  The system has a "screen" (NSScreen) for
 * each monitor that is connected (note the conflicting definitions
 * of screen).  The screen containing the menu bar is screen 0 and the
 * bottom-left corner of this screen is the origin of the "monitor
 * coordinate space".  All other screens are positioned according to this
 * origin.  If the menu bar is on a secondary screen (for example on
 * a monitor hooked up to a laptop), then this screen is screen 0 and
 * other monitors will be positioned according to the "secondary screen".
 * The main screen is the monitor that shows the window that is currently
 * active (has focus), the position of the menu bar does not have influence
 * on this!
 *
 * Upon start up and changes in the layout of screens, we calculate the
 * size of the GdkScreen root window that is needed to be able to place
 * all monitors in the root window.  Once that size is known, we iterate
 * over the monitors and translate their Cocoa position to a position
 * in the root window of the GdkScreen.  This happens below in the
 * function gdk_quartz_screen_calculate_layout().
 *
 * A Cocoa coordinate is always relative to the origin of the monitor
 * coordinate space.  Such coordinates are mapped to their respective
 * position in the GdkScreen root window (_gdk_quartz_window_xy_to_gdk_xy)
 * and vice versa (_gdk_quartz_window_gdk_xy_to_xy).  Both functions can
 * be found in gdkwindow-quartz.c.  Note that Cocoa coordinates can have
 * negative values (in case a monitor is located left or below of screen 0),
 * but GDK coordinates can *not*!
